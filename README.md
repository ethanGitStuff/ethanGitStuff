## My Story
I've always been good with computers, and although I think my love originally stemmed from my time playing video games
it has definitely grow beyond that. I can remember as I entered middle school I attempted (and failed) at learning Java
just as a way to start making Mods for Minecraft. Later, I found myself in a robotics club that used a modified version
of C#, and from that I knew I wanted to continue working with programming. The first langauge I truly understood, and still 
use, was Python when taking a programming class in High School.

Although not from Chicago, through family I was able to move here and I am so glad I did. UIC especially has been a 
wonderful experience that has only strengthened my love of Computer Science with every passing semester. From the 
theoretical classes of mathematical proofs and turning machines to the real application of Software Design using
Java, it has all been such an inspiring ecxperience that makes me more hopeful to enter the workforce.
